# HTML_IDE
A IDE made with html, css and Javascript

I know that has mature project can do this. But I want to make it by myself. Because I want to know how to implement online IDE and my own syntax.

This is an interesting experience. But also I met some problem:
* I can not using <textarea> because I can not change text color in the textarea box. So instead I using div. But it leads to more problems.
    * Using div I can not get the cursor position. So the code completion is hard to do.
    * div is not invent for texting text in it. So it will turn out wrong format.
